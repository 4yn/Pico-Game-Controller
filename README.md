# Pico-Game-Controller

WIP code for a rhythm game controller for the Raspberry Pi Pico.  Intended for 7 key/2 ENC SDVX but should be adaptable to iidx with some work.

Currently working:
- Keyboard & Mouse Mode (7 keys, 2 encoders)
- Reactive LEDs
- sdvx/iidx spoof
- 1000hz polling

TODO:
- gamepad mode for proper spoof/eac compatibility
- hid leds
